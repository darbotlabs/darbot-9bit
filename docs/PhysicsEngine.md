# Physics Engine Documentation

## Features

The Physics Engine provides a set of tools for handling collisions and interactions between game objects. It allows you to detect and resolve collisions, as well as update various physics properties of objects. The main features of the Physics Engine include:

- Detecting collisions between physics objects
- Resolving collisions between physics objects
- Updating physics properties of objects

## Usage

### Adding Physics Objects

To add a physics object, use the `AddPhysicsObject` method:

```csharp
PhysicsEngine physicsEngine = new PhysicsEngine();
PhysicsObject physicsObject = new CustomPhysicsObject();
physicsEngine.AddPhysicsObject(physicsObject);
```

### Removing Physics Objects

To remove a physics object, use the `RemovePhysicsObject` method:

```csharp
physicsEngine.RemovePhysicsObject(physicsObject);
```

### Updating Physics

To update the physics properties and handle collisions, use the `Update` method:

```csharp
physicsEngine.Update();
```

## Tutorial: Implementing Physics in Games

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of implementing physics in a simple game using the Physics Engine.

1. **Create a new Physics Engine instance:**

   ```csharp
   PhysicsEngine physicsEngine = new PhysicsEngine();
   ```

2. **Create and add physics objects:**

   ```csharp
   PhysicsObject player = new PlayerPhysicsObject();
   PhysicsObject enemy = new EnemyPhysicsObject();

   physicsEngine.AddPhysicsObject(player);
   physicsEngine.AddPhysicsObject(enemy);
   ```

3. **Update the physics properties and handle collisions:**

   ```csharp
   physicsEngine.Update();
   ```

Congratulations! You have successfully implemented physics in a simple game using the Physics Engine. Explore the Physics Engine's features to create more complex and realistic physics interactions in your games.
