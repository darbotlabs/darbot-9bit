# 8-bit Video Game Engine

## Project Description

This project aims to build a revolutionary 8-bit video game engine on .NET 10 for Windows 11 using a very cyber retro modern fluent design and the Fluent2 framework. The engine will support modular 8-bit games with voxel graphics and a smooth glow around the edges. Games can be played in 2D or with a 3D perspective.

## Goals

- Create a game development framework that provides tools and libraries for building 8-bit games with voxel graphics.
- Include a level editor for designing game levels and a scripting system for defining game logic.
- Develop a physics engine to handle collisions and interactions between game objects.
- Implement support for various input devices, such as keyboards, game controllers, and touchscreens.
- Provide extensive documentation and tutorials to help developers get started with the framework.
- Develop a set of sample games to showcase the capabilities of the game engine and provide inspiration for developers.
- Create templates for common game genres, such as platformers, puzzle games, and shooters, to help developers get started quickly.
- Include customizable assets, such as sprites, sound effects, and music, to allow developers to create unique games.
- Implement a system for sharing and distributing user-created games and assets within the community.
- Continuously update and improve the engine based on user feedback and emerging technologies.

## Development Environment Setup

1. Install .NET 10 SDK from the official [Microsoft .NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dayour/Dabot-9bit
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd workspace-blank
   ```
4. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).
5. Restore the project dependencies:
   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```
